# D3 sample implementations for circle packing and force directed layout
The code is frontend-only and you can directly open `index.html` in your browsers to explore it. This page is just a simple composition of the two pages in the folder `templates`.

Instructions:
1. You can substitute the data in the folder `static/js/data` as the desired format to replicate your results with this example.
2. The version **D3** library used here is 4.4.0. The code structure among version 3.x.x, 4.x.x and 5.x.x of **D3** is very different, so if you want to modify the frontend code, please pay attention to the version of the document you refer to.
3. For debugging the frontend scripts, you can use the developer tools provided in the browsers. (Right click and select "Inspect Elements" or press F12 in Chrome to show this tool)
